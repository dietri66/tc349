	<p>My sorting process for my final project, the Sparty website redesign, began with asking participants to engage in an open sort. I specified no set categories in order to gain input from participants on what they thought would be appropriate groups for the page. I then chose appropriate categories based on some of the user input that would appropriate and adequate organize the website's content in a meaningful way.  </p>
	<p>
		My sort, as well as my participantsâ€™ sort, varied from the current site architecture drastically. The current site has a index page with lengthy textual descriptions and limited content. Each of the pages on the current site is linked off of this index page and is not categorized. The sort process revealed that the numerous pages on the current site could be condensed into categories to provide architecture with a hierarchy for navigating the web page.  
	</p>
	<p>
		The main differences between my personal sort results and the participants were the category classifications. A few participants created categories that were lengthy. I attempted to keep my categories to the point and brief. Most every participant had different categories than I did. Most of the categories happened to be a name variation on what I had and so came down to a matter of picking the category name that sounded the best.
