        <p>Sparty the Spartan is Michigan State University's fearless and loveable mascot, a figure known throughout the state of Michigan and recognized across the nation. He is big and strong, garnering the honor of being voted "Buffest Mascot" by Muscle and Fitness Magazine. Sparty is also a three time national champion mascot competing at the Universal Cheer Association Nationals Competition in Orlando, Florida. In addition, he participates in events across the country including the NCAA Hall of Champions: Mascot Mania. Despite his size, strength and many accomplishments, Sparty is always available to please any of Michigan State's fans with a hug or friendly high-five.  </p> <br>
