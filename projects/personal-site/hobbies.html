		<li><h4>Drums</h4>
			<p>I spend a lot of time playing drums and making music. I grew up playing drums in High School doing everything from marching band to jazz band. A jazz ensemble I played with in high school was selected as the All-State group my senior year of high school. I have vast interest in many different styles of music </p>

			<h4>Sports</h4>
			<p>I spend at least one day a week attending some kind of sporting event. I am a frequent at MSU Basketball and Football games. I also try to attend a professional sporting event in whatever city I am visiting. I have been to countless NBA games, but little to no NHL or NFL games.</p>

			<h4>Boating</h4>
			<p>I like spending time in the summer out on the lake. Whether for leisure or sport, it is one of my favorite things to do. I enjoy taking an evening round of fishing as the sun sets, and riding a jetski first thing in the morning.</p>
