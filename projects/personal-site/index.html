	<p><em>Welcome to my site!</em></p>
	<p>Check out some of the things I do for fun! See my portfolio of my web development work. I have a passion for learning about web design as I work with web sites daily, and I have a desire to learn a lot more to become more skilled at building web pages. </p>
		<p>I have great interest in cybersecurity, so I have included a piece about one of the first pieces of malware to ever affect the Internet. The Morris Worm is very interesting as to how it affected the Cyberspace community.  Never before did anyone think about the security of their computer networks. The Morris Worm created a whole new field of computer study.</p>
