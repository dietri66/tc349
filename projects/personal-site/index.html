	<p><em>Welcome to my site!</em></p>
	<p>Check out some of the things I do for fun! See my portfolio of my web development work. I have a passion for learning about web design as I work with web sites daily, and I have a desire to learn a lot more to become more skilled at building web pages. </p>

The Morris Worm is very interesting as to how it affected the Cyberspace community.  Never before did anyone think about the security of their computer networks. The Morris Worm created a whole new field of computer study.</p>
