I am operating on a MacBook Pro for my development environment. I have decided to make my development environment consist of three windows. To the left is the TextmMate application. To the right of that is Firefox for displaying my webpages. And in another screen I have a full screen Terminal. 

I chose TextMate after seeing the introductory course videos. I liked the simplicity of the user interface. When I am doing some very large projects or managing ColdFusion sites for work I ususally prefer Dreamweaver. For this class I would like to eliminate the clutter and focus on the markup and css itself and not 20 different property windows. I also like the ease to auto-complete tags in TextMate. I do also like vim, but finding the right piece to allow for tag completion is getting too complicated.

Firefox has been a go to for me. Seems fairly compatible with most web sites and works better with Angel. I like postioning both windows next to each other in order to actively see my code and how it looks within a browser. 

On a second screen, which I get to with a three finger swipe, I have a full screen terminal window. This helps to move files around, commit things to git, and SSH into a web server to modify or add files.
