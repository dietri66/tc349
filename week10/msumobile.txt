The MSU mobile site has a bold header which signifies you are at MSU's page and more specifically the mobile site. The color variance on the background of the header to the body provides a clear distinction of content and header. The search function takes up the width of the screen so the user can easily find a way to locate information on the MSU web page. Each section of the web page is a green graphic with a text description. The advantage of having both provides a way for someone who may not be able to read the description can locate an item by their familiarity with an icon. A user who may not discern the icon can read the text to ensure they click on the correct page. 

As you navigate to a respective section the top header becomes a breadcrumb trail. This is a nice design touch that again includes the icon of the page you are actively on. Instead of navigation using the back button of the browser the user can click on the breadcrumbs to navigate pages. The video page allows users to open YouTube videos even on their mobile devices. The customize home page seems to utilize cookies which allow the user to select what they want to see on the MSU home page. This customizability allows the user to feel comfortable with the page almost as if this is an application native to their mobile phone. There is also a link which allows people to navigate to the full site on a permanent basis providing flexibility if the user does not prefer the mobile site.
