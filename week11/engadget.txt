The Engadget mobile site is a very welcoming experience for use on a mobile device. I use this site daily, so to have a great format for mobile devices makes my life much easier. The site is a responsive layout allowing for easy scaling across screen sizes. This way you also do not miss out on any content unlike some dedicated mobile sites which do not always resemble the content of the full experience. The navigation has only two items to avoid clutter of all the page items. The menu button displays all of the sections the user could visit. While this is a lot of content on the navigation there is structure and organization to properly fit the items within the device’s screen width. The user can also click the search icon to find any articles or pages within Engadget’s web page. 

The main content is similar to the desktop page, but scales everything to fit within the mobile browser. The featured articles are displayed in line fitting the full width of the browser in portrait. Below those images are the news posts. Each has a large easy to read title with small caption for reference. This provides enough information for a user to gain interest in an article. When the user clicks on an article they get all of the content of the article including the embedding of videos. There is no need to pinch and zoom as everything is already scaled to the screen. Some elements are condensed in order to reduce scrolling on the page. These elements are clickable to expand them which still provides a satisfactory experience. 

The only downside to the responsive layout is there is no way to see the standard site on your mobile browser. While all the functionality is present, some may like and be familiar with the layout of the traditional page.
