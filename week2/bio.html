		<h2>Website Critique</h2>
		<p>Panic.com has what appears to be a very non-traditional site. With the lack of clear navigation, this site instantly grabs your attention, and you desire to want to learn more about the page. The initial heading on the home page clearly defines what panic is. This way, users are not fishing around trying to find out what panic is. The icons located below the main heading draw the user to want to scroll over them. When you scroll over the images, they find a small tidbit of information to tell them what the app is about. The textual content on the page is very casual as if someone was talking to you. The informal nature of the text makes the user feel comfortable with page. The footer provides quick access to resources for current app owners, or links to download the apps. </p>
		<p>This page provides a lot of information with very little actual text. Panic makes impressive use of symbols and short succinct descriptions to get the point across without over doing the content. The visual attraction lies in its navigation between app sites using the icons. This navigation is also front and center to the user so they cannot miss it. 
		</p>
		<p>Diving into the individual pages, they each have their own identity making each stand out. These individual pages are slightly more structured with most pages having navigation items that link to help pages, download links, and other information. Each page provides a unique color scheme making distinctions based on what application's page you are visiting. Visual aids swarm each applications page so you can identify features by not even reading the content. This website utilizes a unique structure with a variety of media content. This media content assists the user in navigating the site and drawing their attention to the plethora of content. </p>
