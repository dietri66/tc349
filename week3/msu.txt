MSU Website Critique  

The MSU website has a very appealing look to its home page. Moving from the top down, the navigation is clearly segmented with a contrast to the green background in order to make it standout and apparent to the user as to how to navigate the site. The main image slideshow add great appeal. It provides a large image with engaging animation to draw your attention straight to the slideshow. The mini navigation below the main navigation bar provides links to unique sites to each type of user that may be accessing MSU's website to find information. This helps to make sure each target gets what they are looking for. 

Below the main slideshow image, there is limited content. The content that is included is highly visual with limited text. This grabs the attention of the user to see more of what an image or video is about. The text that is in the bottom half of the page is short and does not take very long to absorb providing enough information to get users to continue to the other page to read a news article. The colors on the page are relatively simple with no more than 5 different colors. The footer seems a bit bulky. It has a large height and seems very disproportionate to the rest of the page. The social media icons are awfully small and would make it difficult for users to discern what they are or click them.
