Etsy.com Critique - Alex Dietrich 

Etsy is an ecommerce site for people to sell their craft creations. The items on this site appear to be everything from clothing to jewlery. Since the site is encouraging people to buy items, it does a great job presenting the items. The homepage shows various featured items. Each item is displayed with a photo instead of a large text description. The visual nature allows all types of users to identify items they want to buy instead of having to click through numerous pages to see a decent photo of the item. The home page also features categories that may be of interest. This feature consists of three slightly larger photos to attract attention to popular categories at the time. 

The navigatin is simple with quick links to register on the site or for returning users to sign in. The large search bar makes it useful for people to easily find a way to locate an item of their interest. The side navigation is simple and to the point. It will direct you to the various types of items. The colors and design will not blow you away. This site maintains a reserved color scheme that simplifies the page and highlights the items to buy.  

When entering the different catagories, the page layout transforms. The page is filled with images of different sizes. There are a few very large images of certain categories, and smaller images for others. Site content could be tailored to users or by what Etsy chooses to promote. These large images could prove effective in attracting attention to certain products.
