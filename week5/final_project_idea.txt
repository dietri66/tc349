The site I would like to redesign for my final project is the Sparty web page. This web page is the home of the World's Greatest Mascot. The only problem is the site is nowhere near the world's greatest site. I would like to create a page just for Sparty. The webpage is currently a part of the Student Alumni Foundation website. I would like to make the page its own website	with its own unique and attractive design. I want to feature multimedia content of Sparty, a more detailed history, and more dynamic content to attract more users and donors for the program.
