Vimeo, most commonly pinged as one of YouTube's archrivals, has differed themselves from YouTube to stand out and attract more visits to their webpage. The first thing that draws the user's attention in is a large heading with the words "Your videos belong here". This large heading is meant to get the user to know and see what their site is for. The site provides a convenient form with three simple fields to engage the user to sign up and follow the advice of the heading to put their videos on Vimeo. 

As you continue to scroll down the page you next encounter a large embedded video that is headlined with "Watch the videos we love." The theme of telling the user what they are seeing is clear throughout the page. The goal of Vimeo is to not complicate things on the page for the user. Links are provided for the user to other videos to watch within that page to engage the user for a long period of time on their webpage. "What can you do here?" is the next heading. This shows the key features of the web page and how having a membership benefits a user. A simple gallery layout is perfect for the image and short caption listing under this section. The "Why is Vimeo different" heading has an interactive image slider to showcase features of Vimeo that make it different from other sites. The page closes with an invitation of sorts to become a part of Vimeo. This main content on the page provides an interactive tour for the user who turns a page as they scroll down and begins to learn Vimeo in a simplistic manner. 

The top navigation on Vimeo is short with 5 elements that link to each key part of the site. These navigation elements are very understandable and not vague. The background styling varies in color as you scroll down the page, but is brought together by the little elements such as the base of the tree extending between sections. These little connecting elements help to establish unity on the Vimeo main page.
