United Pixelworkers is a uniquely designed webpage. The page design uses a gallery type layout with various size sections. The sections each contain a t-shirt image with a description of the shirt. Each of these sections contains nearly all of information needed to know about a t-shirt. The sections provide indication of when you hover over an object. A subtle animation provides you a way of knowing what item you are looking at and makes the item stand out a little bit. The gallery layout is fluid and properly scales as you shrink the browser window. The columns will condense to a proper size, and the navigation will condense to make the content fit within the page. The condensed navigation still makes links to pages accessible, but makes sure the links are not smashed together in the header.

The website uses a simple solid color scheme throughout. The header has distinct background colors that separate the items in the header from each other. This allows for segmentation of the various objects such as letting people easily find their shopping cart. The main content area keeps the background simple by leaving it a plain white color. This allows for any content displayed to stand out and not get muddled up within the background color. Many of the gallery section items vary in color with their descriptions, which allows for distinction between different items. The footer has a distinct blue background which signifies it is a different spot of the page and that this is the end of the page.
